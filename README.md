# Train-Schedule
What is it?
This is a mock train schedule display board. It takes information from the DOM and stores in html and in a database called Firebase. 

How does it work?
On the front end, I used bootstrap for the html structure and grid layout system. I then created a form that takes data and is supposed to load into the table (that feature is under construction.)
Simultaneously on the backend the information is stored in the Firebase database, it is all done with one click event.
